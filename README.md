# NODEroboclaire

It's a node.js version of roboclaire for a more twitch-api friendly existence.

## tmi.js, comfy.js, and dotenv

This project uses the modules tmi.js, comfy.js, and dotenv in order to
* Connect to and wrap around twitch IRC
* Simplify the transfer of commands from browser-based roboclaire to this roboclaire
* Hide enviroment variables, such as OAUTH tokens

### Configuring NODEroboclaire for yourself

As of right now, NODEroboclaire is written in such a way that it requires editing the code to customize. Once NODEroboclaire is fully functional, this will be updated to fix that problem.
